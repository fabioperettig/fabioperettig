# Hello there, welcome to my Github.
## My name is Fabio Peretti and my nickname is "fabioperettig"!

As a **designer** with **15 years of experience** in **Design** and **Motion Graphics**, I have recently decided to explore and deepen my knowledge in the field of **programming** and **technology**. My journey began a few years ago when I started creating “expressions” for my animations in After Effects. I quickly realized that I was more interested in observing the process of the effect in code than seeing the effect itself. Over time, I gained experience and developed some front-end projects in **JavaScript**. However, I discovered that **back-end** development is what truly sparks my interest. Currently, I am honing my skills in **Java** (the good old Java root).
